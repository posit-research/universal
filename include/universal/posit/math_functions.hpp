In mathematics, an elementary function is a function of one variable which is a finite sum, 
product, and/or composition of the rational functions (P(x)/Q(x) for polynomials P and Q), 
sin, cos, exp, and their inverse functions (including arcsin, log, x^(1/n)).

Elementary functions were introduced by Joseph Liouville in a series of papers from 1833 to 1841. 
An algebraic treatment of elementary functions was started by Joseph Fels Ritt in the 1930s.
